# ðŸ“š Resources

Welcome to my personal collection of handwritten and self-made notes!

I love writing notes, it helps me truly understand a topic. I usually go through multiple resources, gather insights, and then summarize everything in one place for a deeper understanding.

These notes are the result of that process. My way of learning, simplifying, and revisiting complex topics.
